# LEGO Postgresql Analysis

This project explores the LEGO dataset from Kaggle using Postgresql. 

It demonstrates: 
- Basic SQL commands 
- Advanced SQL features (functions and anonymous do block)
- Automated export of query results to CSV
- Plot generation from SQL precedures

## Dataset
The original dataset can be found at: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/lego-database). 

The dataset has been compiled into Postgresql database and it can be found via this [link](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/postgres-sample-dbs?tab=readme-ov-file#lego-database).

## Repository Structure
- `sql` - All SQL scripts including queries, anonymous blocks, and functions
- `output/figures/` - Plots generated from SQL
- `output/exports/` - CSV exports generated from SQL
- `report.md` - Detailed report including analyses and discussion
